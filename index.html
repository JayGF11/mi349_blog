                <h3>Follow Hot Trends But Don't Follow It</h3>
            <p>
                Sellers who catch onto a trend early on before it reaches
                a climax will maximize their profit. Therefore, you must 
                realize the hot trends at the soonest time possible. 
                However, do <b>not</b> sell trending products 
                because you will compete with other reputable and/or large
                companies where you have minimal chance in converting 
                views to sales. Instead, look for accessories or related 
                products that customers will most likely purchase as an 
                add-on to the trending product.

                The image is a screenshot of searches for "nintendo switch" 
                in blue and "Animal Crossing" in red from March to July of 2020. 
                Animal Crossing was a very popular game which was only available 
                on the Nintendo Switch. Notice how the trend of the game follows 
                the console? You would maximize your conversion rate if you 
                focused on selling related products rather than the trending 
                item itself. In other words, your conversion rate for related 
                products corresponds to the trending product, but you have 
                significantly less competitors which gives you more chance 
                to make a sale.

            <h2>Muscle Gain During Fat Loss</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    By <a href="about.html"><span>Jamie Guo</span></a> on <time datetime="2020-10-10">Oct. 10, 2020</time>

                Bodybuilders have traditionally followed the bulking-to-cutting phase
                to transform their bodies. It has been believed by many for decades 
                that doing both simultaneously is hindering your progress. However, 
                new studies have proved that this is very well possible and in fact
                it is more efficient in giving you the results you've always wanted.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase Busted</h3>
            <p>
                There are many people who still believe in the phasing method. You can't 
                blame them because the traditional method makes sense. The bulking phase 
                allows the body to put on as much mass as possible whether it is fat or
                muscle. People increase protein and carbohydrate consumption 
                to provide the body with energy and nutrients to lift more in the gym
                and activate protein synthesis for maximum muscle growth. Then, the 
                cutting phase is where people reduce calorie consumption to reach the 
                state of caloric defecit which is how the body loses mass. However, this
                phase also loses muscle along with fat. The new method avoids the problems
                present in the traditional method. You can actually lose fat while building
                muscle. The key here is to increase protein consumption and still be
                in a caloric defecit.
            </p>
            <p><img src="graph.png" alt="Graph shows protein synthesis during fat loss." width=384 height=258>Graph</img></p>

            <p>
                The graph shows stats of mass change for people in a caloric defecit. Shown 
                on the left is people who consume only 5% of their calories from protein 
                compared to 15% and 25%. We can conclude that protein synthesis occurs when
                you consume at least 15% of calories from protein while still reducing fat 
                mass. The optimal percentage may be between 15% and 25% so stick to about 
                20% daily calories from protein.
