    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Currently studying at Michigan State University and expected to graduate as class
        of 2021 in Spring. I've always been interested in working on computers but I do
        seek for new activites to introduce variety to my work. My main hobbies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Participate in MI349 at MSU</li>
        <li>Web design</li>
        <li>Working out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I also like to travel if time allows. Aside from enjoying being in different places,
        I look forward to observe different locations to gain inspiration and apply
        them to my work.
